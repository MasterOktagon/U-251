Escape the allied forces in this Bullet hell/Stealth game. Decide carefully if you want to rush on the waves or take a deeper, less dangerous route but which drains your pressure and is littered with minefields.
The game is not completed but still challenging to beat.

### Controls

- Use WASD to move around on the map. You can only turn while moving.
- Use Q+E to move up and down. Use the right height bar to check for enemy mines, torpedos and the ground.
- Use Page up + Page down to zoom
- Use SPACE to spawn a noisemaker attracting the enemy torpedos in range (5s cooldown)

TIP: don't run into or (to) near the coast

**DISCLAIMER:** This game uses some elements of conspiracy theorys as a lore element. This is not due to us belivieving in them but to poke fun of them.
